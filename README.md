Wordle Game Clone
Overview
This project is a Wordle game clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Wordle game is a word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback through color-coded blocksâ€”green for correct letters in the right place, yellow for correct letters in the wrong place, and grey for incorrect letters.

Project Folder Structure

The project folder contains three essential files:

index.html: The HTML document providing the structure of the game.
style.css: The stylesheet for styling the game interface.
script.js: The JavaScript file adding functionality and logic to the game.
How to Build the Wordle Clone
1. Project Setup
Before building the game, create a folder named build to organize the source code. Optionally, set up a development server (e.g., live-server) for automatic page reloading during development.

2. Creating the Game Board
Implement the game board, where the hidden word is displayed, and feedback blocks indicate correct and incorrect guesses.

3. Creating the On-screen Keyboard
Develop an on-screen keyboard to facilitate user input for guessing the word.

4. Accepting User Input
Implement the logic to accept and process user input, updating the game board accordingly.

5. Adding Notifications
Provide feedback to the player through notifications, indicating the correctness of their guesses.

6. Making the On-screen Keyboard Generate Input
Develop the logic for the on-screen keyboard to generate input events, allowing users to interact with the game.

7. Adding Animation
Enhance the user experience by adding animations to create a more engaging and visually appealing game interface.

Feel free to explore each step in more detail, adding explanations as you progress through the development of your Wordle game clone.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
